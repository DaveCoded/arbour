## Who is this for?

People who know at least a little about web development. It's built with core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so it helps to know these. Ideally you know more than a little, but others can Google/ChatGPT their way through unfamiliar steps in the process.

You'll need to know how to clone a Git repo, npm install the project, edit HTML and markdown files in a text editor, and deploy your garden somewhere like Netlify or Vercel.
