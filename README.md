# Arbour

- Cross-post micro content to other sites: Bluesky, Mastodon, Instagram, and Facebook
- Fine-grained control of RSS publishing â€“ choose what to publish and when
- Beautiful, minimalist design
- Readable typography

## Who is this for?

People who know at least a little about web development. Ideally you know more than a little, but others can Google/ChatGPT their way through unfamiliar steps in the process.

It's built with core web technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Markdown. If you want to edit or customise your Arbour setup, you'll need to learn some basics about those.

At the very least, you'll need to know how to clone a Git repo, `npm install` or `yarn install` the project, edit HTML and markdown files in a text editor, and deploy your garden somewhere like Netlify or Vercel.

This requires knowing how to use the command line, having git and npm installed on your machine, and using a text editor like VS Code.
