# Version Control Spec

## Problem and Context

In writing on my garden, I’ve found updating posts tricky. Here’s what happens: I publish a rough piece of work, post it to Twitter, and people give me a bunch of useful feedback and additional references to look at.

I now want to update my post to incorporate the new information I’ve learned. But I also would like to preserve the original. Having a versioning system on posts would allow the writer to revise their work without losing the original.

Preserving the original and having visible versioning is helpful because:
- The people who gave me feedback and references can see I incorporated their ideas and updated the post. I can share an updated version, thanking them for their ideas and crediting them. Having access to both the original and revised version makes clear that the content has changed.
- People who find the post via a comment about the original version aren’t confused when the comment no longer matches the content.
	For example, a comment might say “I like this, but it should mention X”. When they click through to the piece, they find a large section about X. That would be confusing.
- People can see how a long piece evolved over time. This shows the reader that you can publish something a bit shitty to the web, and slowly improve it in stages. It makes the process of growing a piece in public more transparent.

I think having version control will also help lower the friction to publishing. Without one, it’s unclear when a piece has been substantially updated or improved. With one, I predict it will feel easier to publish crappy V0 drafts. You now have an explicit, built-in system for revising that draft, and you don’t need to worry about readers being confused as the content evolves.

## Proposed Solution

Give each macro post its own version history.
Every post starts as V0 by default, and then increments to V1, V2, etc.
Each post should visually show
