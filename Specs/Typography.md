# Typography Spec

Need to pick beautiful, readable typefaces. Give people something free by default, but suggest options for paid-for typefaces.

Setup a fluid type scale that adjusts to browser resizing and devices.

## Body copy

**Serif** – Would strongly recommend serifs for body copy

Free
- [Lora](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lora?stroke=Serif) (free, Google fonts) – Clearly the best choice.
- [PT Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/PT+Serif?stroke=Serif) (free, Google fonts) – X-height is taller than I like, but maybe people are into it.

Paid
- [Canela Text](https://commercialtype.com/catalog/canela) – Commerical Type, $125 for regular, italic, and bold
- [Tiempos Text](https://klim.co.nz/retail-fonts/tiempos-text/) – Kilm Type Foundry, $144 for regular, italic, and bold.
- [Freight Text](https://freightcollection.com/) – $105 for regular, italic, and bold

**Sans-serif**

Free
- [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) – Honestly the only choice.
- [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans?stroke=Sans+Serif) – Maybe if you have to

Depends on the body copy choice
