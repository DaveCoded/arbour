# Micro and Macro Content Spec

## Problem and Context

People tend to create two sizes of content on the web: micro content like Tweets, and macro content like blog posts and essays.

**Micro posts**

Micro posts are very small pieces of content â€“ they tend to be 1-3 sentences long. They don't have titles, descriptions, or tags. They're quick and easy to write, and sometimes act as the seeds of larger ideas. Their brevity is a feature, not a bug. You have to state your point clearly and concisely.

People tend to publish micro posts on large, proprietary platforms like Twitter/X, Mastodon, Threads, and Tumblr. Likely because micro posts are well suited to social interactions. They're invitations for conversation and banter. So you need to publish them somewhere other people can respond to them.

While the social benefits of publishing to centralised social media make sense, the trade-off is we don't have control and ownership over the words we're writing. Elon is likely to burn down the Twitter/X servers at some point, and all our clever thoughts, poems, insights, and clap backs will go with it. Having them on a separate proprietary platform also means you can't connect your micro posts to the rest of your ideas.

**Macro posts**

Macro posts are what we traditionally find on blogs and gardens. They're medium to long-form content that has a title and a body. They may also have a description, tags, and multiple versions.

**The problem**

Almost no blogging frameworks or platform supports both micro and macro content.

These two sizes need to be treated differently. You read, browse, and navigate through micro and macro content in different ways.
